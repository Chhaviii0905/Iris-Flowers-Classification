This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying Iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in the machine learning community. The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset used in this project is available in the data directory. It consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of the three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample contains the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)

To run the code and experiments in this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebooks)
